3. Click the **GitHub** tab
4. Enter repository URL
5. Browse to the chapter you need
6. Click on the notebook to open it

### Method 2: Download and Upload

1. Go to the GitHub repository in your web browser
2. Navigate to the notebook file (`.ipynb`)
3. Click on the file, then click **Raw**
4. Right-click → Save As → Save to your computer
5. In Colab: **File → Upload Notebook**
6. Select the file you downloaded

## Step 4: Saving Your Work

**IMPORTANT:** Colab notebooks are NOT automatically saved to your Google Drive unless you save them manually.

### To Save Your Work:

1. **File → Save a copy in Drive**
2. This creates a copy in your Google Drive under "Colab Notebooks" folder
3. Rename it appropriately (e.g., "GP01-Meet-Your-AI-Assistant-YourName")

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Runtime disconnected"
- **Solution:** Click "Reconnect" and re-run your cells

### "Cannot find file/data"
- **Solution:** Use the Files panel (📁 icon on left) → Upload

### Notebook won't run
- Try: **Runtime → Restart runtime**
- Clear outputs: **Edit → Clear all outputs**
- Then re-run cells from top to bottom
