# Non-Guided Project 1: AI-in-My-World

## Instructions

### Hands-On Challenge: AI in My World (40-60 minutes)

**Objective**: Document and analyze AI systems you encounter in your daily life, then create a Python program to organize and visualize your findings.

**Part 1: Discovery (15 minutes)**

Over the next day, keep track of every AI system you interact with. For each one, note:
- What it does
- When you used it
- Which category it falls into (Recognition, Prediction, Generation, Recommendation, Optimization)
- Whether you were aware it was AI before this exercise

**Part 2: Python Analysis (25-35 minutes)**

Create a new Google Colab notebook and use Python to analyze your findings
