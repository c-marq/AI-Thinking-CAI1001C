## Key Topics to Review

This guide is organized into the five main topics covered in the quiz. Focus your studying on these areas.

### 1. Core AI Definitions

You must be able to clearly define and differentiate between the core concepts of AI.

| Term | Definition | Key Idea |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | The broad field of computer science dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. | The overall concept of intelligent machines. |
| **Machine Learning (ML)** | A subset of AI where systems **learn from data and examples** to make predictions or decisions, rather than being explicitly programmed for a specific task. | **Learning from data** is the key differentiator. |
| **Deep Learning (DL)** | A specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn from vast amounts of data. It is the engine behind most modern AI breakthroughs. | A powerful, data-hungry technique within ML. |

**Analogy to Remember**: Think of it as a family tree: **AI is the grandparent, Machine Learning is the parent, and Deep Learning is the child.**

### 2. The History of AI

Understanding the key milestones helps contextualize where AI is today.

| Year | Event | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1950 | **The Turing Test** | Proposed by Alan Turing as a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. |
| 1956 | **Dartmouth Conference** | The event where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was officially coined, marking the birth of AI as a formal field of research. |
| 1974-1993 | **AI Winters** | Periods of reduced funding and interest in AI research, often caused by overly optimistic promises and technical limitations. |
| 1997 | **IBM's Deep Blue** | A chess-playing computer that defeated the reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, showing AI could master complex, strategic tasks. |
| 2012 | **The Deep Learning Revolution** | Sparked by AlexNet, a deep neural network that won the ImageNet competition by a huge margin, proving the power of deep learning for tasks like image recognition. |
| 2016 | **Google's AlphaGo** | An AI that defeated the world's top Go player, a game considered much more intuitive and complex than chess. |

### 3. The Five Categories of AI Applications

Be able to identify and provide examples for the five primary ways AI is used in the real world.

| Category | Goal | Real-World Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recognition** | Identify or classify objects, patterns, or features. | Unlocking your phone with your face (facial recognition). |
| **Prediction** | Forecast future outcomes based on historical data. | A bank's AI predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default. |
| **Generation** | Create new, original content (text, images, music). | Using ChatGPT to write an email or DALL-E to create an image from a text prompt. |
| **Recommendation** | Suggest items of interest to a user. | Netflix suggesting movies or Amazon recommending products based on your viewing/purchase history. |
| **Optimization** | Find the most efficient solution to a problem with many variables. | Google Maps finding the fastest route by analyzing current traffic conditions. |

### 4. The AI Project Cycle

Know the five phases of a typical AI project **in the correct order**.

1.  **Problem Definition**: Clearly define the business problem to be solved and determine if AI is the right solution.
2.  **Data Collection & Preparation**: Gather, clean, and label the data needed to train the AI model. **This is the most time-consuming phase (often 60-80% of the project).**
3.  **Model Development**: Select an appropriate algorithm and train the model on the prepared data.
4.  **Deployment**: Integrate the trained model into a real-world application so it can be used.
5.  **Evaluation & Monitoring**: Continuously check the model's performance to ensure it remains accurate and effective over time.

**Key Concepts**: 
*   **Iterative Process**: The cycle is not linear; teams often loop back to earlier phases.
*   **"Garbage in, garbage out"**: The quality of an AI model is entirely dependent on the quality of the data it is trained on.

### 5. Python and Google Colab Basics

Familiarize yourself with the fundamental tools used in this course.

*   **Google Colab**: A free, cloud-based environment that lets you write and execute Python code in your browser. It's ideal for AI projects because it provides access to powerful hardware (GPUs) for free.
*   **Code Cells vs. Text Cells**: In Colab, you write and run Python code in **Code Cells**. You write notes, add images, and format text using Markdown in **Text Cells**.
*   **Python Comments**: Use the hash (`#`) symbol to add comments to your code. The computer ignores any text on a line that follows a `#`.
*   **List Indexing**: In Python, lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first item is at index `0`. To get the first item in `my_list`, you use `my_list[0]`.
*   **`NameError`**: This is a common error that occurs when you try to use a variable that has not yet been defined.

## Study Tips

*   **Don't just memorize definitions.** Understand the *relationship* between concepts (e.g., how ML is a type of AI).
*   **Use the analogies.** The AI Family Tree and the "Garbage in, garbage out" principle are powerful ways to remember key ideas.
*   **Review the historical timeline.** Know the significance of each major event.
*   **Think of your own examples** for the five categories of AI applications.
*   **Practice!** Open Google Colab and try writing a comment or accessing an item from a list.

Good luck!
