## Key Topics to Review

This guide is organized into the four main topics covered in the quiz. Focus your studying on these areas.

### 1. The Five Components of Digital Literacy

Digital literacy is more than just knowing how to use a computer. It is the ability to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information using digital technologies. You must know and understand its five core components.

| Component | Description | Example Skill |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Finding Information** | Going beyond simple searches to locate credible and relevant data. | Using advanced search operators like `site:gov` or `filetype:pdf`. |
| **2. Evaluating Information** | Critically assessing the credibility, accuracy, and bias of digital sources. | Applying the CRAAP test to a news article. |
| **3. Creating Content** | Producing digital work, such as code, documentation, or data visualizations. | Writing a documented Jupyter Notebook to analyze data. |
| **4. Communicating & Collaborating** | Using digital tools to work effectively with others. | Collaborating on a project using Google Docs and GitHub. |
| **5. Understanding Context & Implications** | Recognizing the broader privacy, ethical, and social impacts of technology. | Questioning who owns the data generated by a smart thermostat. |

**Key Distinction**: Remember the difference between **Digital Skills** (knowing *how* to use a tool) and **Digital Literacy** (knowing *when, why*, and the *implications* of using it).

### 2. Evaluating Digital Information: The CRAAP Test

In an age of AI-generated content and misinformation, the ability to evaluate sources is critical. The primary tool for this is the **CRAAP test**.

| Letter | Stands For | Key Question to Ask |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C** | **Currency** | How recent is this information? Is it up-to-date for my topic? |
| **R** | **Relevance** | Does this information directly relate to my topic? Who is the intended audience? |
| **A** | **Authority** | Who is the author or publisher? What are their credentials? |
| **A** | **Accuracy** | Is the information supported by evidence? Can I verify it with other sources? |
| **P** | **Purpose** | Why was this information created? Is it meant to inform, persuade, or sell something? |

**Advanced Search Operators**: Be familiar with how to refine searches.

| Operator | Function | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `"exact phrase"` | Searches for the exact wording. | `"machine learning"` |
| `site:domain.com` | Limits results to a specific website. | `site:gov` or `site:edu` |
| `filetype:ext` | Finds specific file types. | `filetype:pdf` or `filetype:csv` |
| `-excludedword` | Removes results with a specific word. | `python tutorial -video` |

### 3. Data Sources and Collection Methods

Data is the fuel for AI. You need to know where it comes from and how it is collected.

#### Types of Data by Source

| Data Type | Description | Characteristics | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Human-Generated** | Data created directly by people. | Subjective, rich in context, requires interpretation. | Social media posts, online reviews, survey responses, purchase history. |
| **Machine-Generated** | Data automatically created by systems and sensors. | Objective, highly structured, continuous, high volume. | Server logs, sensor readings (temperature, GPS), ATM transaction logs. |
| **Hybrid** | Combines human actions with machine recording. | Mixes human choice with automated data capture. | E-commerce clicks, fitness tracker data, smart home usage. |

#### Data Collection Methods

| Method | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Active Collection** | The user knowingly and directly provides the data. | Filling out a form, posting on social media, taking a survey. |
| **Passive Collection** | Data is collected automatically in the background without direct user action. | A fitness tracker recording your heart rate, a website using cookies. |

### 4. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Privacy

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors and software that connect to the internet to exchange data. This includes everything from smart thermostats and fitness trackers to connected cars.

#### Key Concepts

*   **Time-Series Data**: IoT devices typically generate **time-series data**—a sequence of data points recorded over time (e.g., hourly temperature readings). This data is characterized by its **high frequency** and continuous nature.

*   **Data Ownership**: A critical and often ambiguous question. The owner of IoT data (the user, the manufacturer, or both) is usually defined in the device's **Terms of Service**. The answer is: **It varies by device and terms of service.**

*   **Privacy is about control, not hiding**: The chapter emphasizes that privacy is not about "having something to hide." It is about **controlling your personal information** and preventing its misuse.

#### What IoT Devices Can Reveal

| Device | Data Collected | What It Can Reveal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Smart Thermostat | Temperature, occupancy, schedule | When you're home, your sleep schedule, daily routines. |
| Fitness Tracker | Steps, heart rate, GPS, sleep | Your location history, health conditions, exercise habits. |
| Smart Speaker | Voice commands, music choices | Daily routines, shopping habits, potentially overheard conversations. |

### 5. Python and Pandas Basics

The chapter introduces the **Pandas** library for working with data in Python.

*   **`pd.DataFrame()`**: The function used to create a spreadsheet-like data structure called a DataFrame.
*   **`df.mean()`**: Calculates the average of a numerical column in a DataFrame named `df`.

## Sample Quiz Questions

Review these questions to get a feel for the quiz format.

1.  **(Multiple Choice)** Which of the following is NOT one of the five core components of digital literacy?
    a.  Finding Information
    b.  Memorizing Keyboard Shortcuts
    c.  Evaluating Information
    d.  Understanding Context and Implications

2.  **(True/False)** Passive data collection happens when a user knowingly and actively provides information, like filling out a form.

3.  **(Short Answer)** What does the acronym CRAAP stand for when evaluating a source?

## Study Tips

*   **Know the CRAAP test by heart.** You will be asked what each letter stands for.
*   **Understand the difference** between active and passive data collection, and between human-generated and machine-generated data.
*   **Think about the "why."** Don't just memorize that IoT devices collect data; understand *what* they can reveal about a person's life and *why* that's a privacy concern.
*   **Practice using search operators.** Know the syntax for `site:`, `filetype:`, and `"exact phrase"`.

Good luck!
