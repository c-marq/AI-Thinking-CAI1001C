# Guided Project 1: Python Basics Demo
**Chapter 1: Welcome to the Age of AI**

**Due:** End of class  
**Format:** Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)  
**Submission:** Upload completed notebook to Canvas

---

## Overview

This guided project helps you practice the Python fundamentals introduced in Chapter 1. You'll work through a demonstration notebook that covers variables, lists, basic calculations, and loops—all the building blocks you need for AI and data analysis.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Creating and using variables
- Storing data in lists
- Performing calculations
- Analyzing data with built-in functions
- Using for loops to process data

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Notebook

1. Go to the course GitHub repository: [your-repo-link-here]
2. Navigate to **Guided Projects → GP01_Python_Basics_Demo**
3. Click on `GP01-Python-Basics-Demo.ipynb`
4. Click the **"Open in Colab"** badge at the top of the notebook
   - OR click the **Raw** button, copy the URL, then go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and use **File → Open notebook → GitHub** and paste the URL
5. **Important**: Once opened, click **File → Save a copy in Drive** so your work is saved to your Google Drive!

### Step 2: Work Through Parts 1-6 (In Class)

We'll complete these sections together as a class:

**Part 1: Variables** (10 minutes)
- Run each code cell
- Follow along as instructor explains
- Complete the "Try It Yourself" section with your own information

**Part 2: Basic Math** (10 minutes)
- See how Python does calculations
- Modify the temperature example with this week's actual temperatures

**Part 3: Lists** (10 minutes)
- Learn how to store multiple values
- Practice accessing items by index

**Part 4: Analyzing Lists** (10 minutes)
- Use `sum()`, `max()`, `min()` functions
- Calculate averages and statistics

**Part 5: For Loops** (10 minutes)
- Process each item in a list
- Print formatted output

**Part 6: Complete Example** (10 minutes)
- See all concepts working together
- Miami Beach temperature analysis

### Step 3: Complete Part 7 Independently (20-30 minutes)

**Your Task:** Complete the weekly spending analysis

The code is already written but you need to:

1. **Replace the sample data** with your own estimated weekly spending (or keep the sample data)
2. **Run all the code cells** to see your analysis
3. **Add one extension** from the suggestions:
   - Count days you spent more than $40
   - Calculate weekend vs. weekday average
   - Check if you're under/over a $200 weekly budget
   - Add spending categories (food, transport, entertainment)

**Write your extension code in a new cell at the end of Part 7**

## Deliverables

Submit your completed notebook with:

✅ **Parts 1-6 completed** - All cells run successfully with output visible

✅ **Part 7 completed** with:
   - Your own spending data (or sample data is fine)
   - All cells run and showing output
   - At least **one extension** coded in a new cell

✅ **Your name** at the top of the notebook in a text cell

## Grading (10 points)

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Parts 1-6: All cells run successfully | 3 pts |
| Part 7: Spending analysis completed | 4 pts |
| Part 7: At least one extension added | 2 pts |
| Notebook organized, name included | 1 pt |
| **Total** | **10 pts** |

---

## Tips for Success

✅ **Run cells in order** - Don't skip around or cells might error

✅ **Read the explanations** - The "What's Happening?" sections explain the code

✅ **Experiment!** - Try changing values and re-running cells

✅ **Ask questions** - Raise your hand if you get stuck

✅ **Save frequently** - Use Ctrl+S (Windows) or Cmd+S (Mac)

❌ **Don't stress about perfection** - This is practice!

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem:** "NameError: name 'temperatures' is not defined"  
**Solution:** Run the cell that creates the `temperatures` list first

**Problem:** Notebook won't save  
**Solution:** Make sure you saved a copy to your Google Drive first

**Problem:** Output looks weird  
**Solution:** Click **Runtime → Restart and run all** to start fresh

**Problem:** Code has errors  
**Solution:** Check for typos - Python is case-sensitive and spacing matters!

## Extension Ideas (Optional, for Extra Practice)

If you finish early, try these challenges:

### Easy Extensions:
1. Change the temperature example to Celsius instead of Fahrenheit
2. Add more fruits to the fruits list and print them
3. Calculate your total spending for a month (weekly × 4)

### Medium Extensions:
4. Create a list of your 5 favorite AI apps with ratings (1-5)
5. Calculate the average rating
6. Count how many apps you rated 4 or higher

### Challenging Extensions:
7. Create separate spending lists for weekdays and weekend
8. Compare the averages
9. Print which period you spent more

## What's Next?

After this project, you'll be ready to:
- Work with more complex data structures
- Write your own functions
- Analyze real datasets with pandas
- Build simple AI applications

These Python basics are the foundation for everything else in the course!
